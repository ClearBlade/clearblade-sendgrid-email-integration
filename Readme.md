## Setup

- Create a free SendGrid Account. 
- Log into your SendGrid account, and view the Settings > API Keys tab. Create an API Key with full access to "Mail Send" rights.
- Update `SendGridConstants` Library

```js
// TODO Use your own credentials, these are examples
var SEND_GRID_TOKEN = "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"
var ORIGIN_EMAIL = "example@sendgrid.com";
var EMAIL_RECIPIENTS = ["email1@email.com"]
```

- Add 'SendGridEmail' as a dependency to any of your code services (Settings > Requires > Add)

## Usage

Run `ExampleSendEmailPlaintext` Code Service, also here for reference:

```js
var sgEmail = SendGridEmail(SEND_GRID_TOKEN, ORIGIN_EMAIL)
sgEmail.SendEmailToList("Alert!", "ClearBlade Email Alert", EMAIL_RECIPIENTS, function(err, data){
     if(err){
         resp.error(err)
     }
     var message = "Successful email sent!"
     resp.success(message);
});
```
